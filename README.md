# Raycong: A Pong Game!

Raycong is a simple pong game made using the C programming language with the help of [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) library.

Raycong is my first C project after learning C programming in my first semester of college.

## Development
I followed [this](https://youtu.be/VLJlTaFvHo4) YouTube tutorial while developing this project. In the tutorial, the language used is C++ but I have used C in this game. 

I have used 'structs' instead of classes and have made use of functions with pointers to achieve the same results as using functions inside of classes in C++ as done in the tutorial.

## Playing
If you just wanna play the game, you can download only the ```main.exe``` file and run it. The controls are ```↑``` and ```↓``` (or ```w``` and ```s```) to move up and down respectively.

## Setup
To setup this project locally on your windows machine:
1. Install Raylib using one of their binary [releases](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases) on GitHub.
2. Install VScode. 
3. Clone or download this repository and open the Racong folder in VScode (or alternatively, just open the  ```main.code-workspace``` file). 
4. Open the ```main.c``` file and press ```F5``` or ```Fn + F5``` to build the project. 
5. You're ready to make your own changes to the project!

## Contributing
Feel free to report any bugs by opening an issue. Also, if you'd like to contribute, I would recommend forking the project or if it's a minor bugfix/issue, a pull request would be welcome.
